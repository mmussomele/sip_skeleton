# sip_skeleton
Over Summer 2015, I was one of 4 instructors that designed and taught an intro CS course intended for high school students. This repository contains my contributions, created over the course of about 2 weeks. The full repository can be found [here](https://github.com/SIP-2015/skeleton).
