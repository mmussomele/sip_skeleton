Welcome to this basic bash terminal tutorial!
Here you will learn what you need to use your terminal effectively in this course. 

Basic useful commands:

    cd [DIR]                - moves into the given directory   
    ls [DIR...]             - print the contents of the given directories
    echo [TEXT]             - prints the given text to the screen
    echo [TEXT] > [DEST]    - overwrites the file at the destination with the given text
    echo [TEXT] >> [DEST]   - append the given text to the file at the destination
    touch [FILE...]         - creates the given files if it doesn't exist
    rm [FILE...]            - delete the given files
    rm -r [DIR...]          - delete
    mkdir [DIR...]          - creates the given folders if they don't exist
    cp [FILE] [DEST]        - copies the given file to the given destination, overwriting it the destination is an 
                              existing file and adding it if it is an existing folder
    cp -a [DIR] [DEST]      - copies the given file to the given destination
    mv [FILE] [DEST]        - moves the given file/directory to the given destination (like cut and paste)
                              NOTE: This can also be used to rename files/folders
    cat [FILE...]           - print the contents of the given files to the terminal

C++ related commands:
    
    g++ [FILE...] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]  - compiles all the given files into one file named OUTPUT_FILE
    make                            - runs a file named 'makefile' if it is present (we will talk about these later)
    make -f [FILE]                  - runs the given file as if it were a makefile


Constants and Wildcards:

    .   - the current directory
    ..  - the current parent directory
    ~   - your home directory (either /home/YOURUSERNAME or /Users/YOURUSERNAME)
    /   - the root directory (like C:\ in Windows)
    *   - match any file
    **  - match any folder

Tab Completion: When typing out a command, pressing <TAB> will have your terminal attempt to autocomplete it.
                If there are multiple possibilities, hitting <TAB> twice will display them all.

            ex/ 
                username     ~/     $ cd Do<TAB><TAB>   # attempt to autocomplete "cd Do", but there are two possible folders
                Documents/ Downloads/                   # bash displays the possibilities
                username     ~/     $ cd Doc<TAB>       # change input to "cd Doc", now there is only one possible folder
                username     ~/     $ cd Documents      # bash can complete your command without any error
                username     ~/Documents     $          # hitting enter moves you into the ~/Documents directory


Once you've finished reading this, go back to your terminal and execute "cat THEN_HERE".
